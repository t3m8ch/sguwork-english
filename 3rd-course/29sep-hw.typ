Hello everyone,

We'd like to thank everyone for their who has helped
us to raise money for Save the Children over the past
12 months. We've successfully raised 5000 pounds!

We really hope you have enjoyed the various events that
we have organised this year. First we had a Autumn Marathon
in September. Fifty of us ran a 10 kilometers and raised
3000 pounds. Then 300 people came to our unforgettable
1990s karaoke evening in October. And don't forget to come
our Quiz Night in next week. There are some amazing prizes!

Last year Save the Children helped 10 million children around
the world. Our money are children's lives and a better future
for our Earth. It's possible only thanks to you and your
donations. So even 3 pounds can save lives of 8 children with
stomach virus.

Would you like to help us raise more money for STC? Please
email me for info about future events. Thanks again for all
your help!
