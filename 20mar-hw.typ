Hi Paul!

I'm really having a nice holiday. I'm gone to Saint Petersburg.
There are so many historical buildings. I think it's one of the most
beautiful russian city.

I'm not staying in the hotel. I'm staying with my family.

I'm sightseeing every day. For example, I visited the Hermitage yesterday.

How are you? Is everything okay?

Love
Becky
